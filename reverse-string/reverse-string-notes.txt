-le is the less than operator
Otherwise power shell for loops are like C for loops.

Unlike bash, varialbes must be references as $var when assigning/defining.

When a function is defined in a file, need to run the file to  invoke the definition.

Type Invoke-Pester to run the unit tests. Does this need that I have manually defined the function?
